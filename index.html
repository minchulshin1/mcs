         <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
        <P><CENTER>In terms of interest in IT and my personal experiences. 
         I was very interested in IT as the significance of IT has been dramatically increased these days and it 
         becomes such a vital thing to make society changed. So that I wanted to learn and know about IT more like how vast information exchanges,
         how it solves the problem. </CENTER></P>
         <h2>IT experience</h2>
        <P><CENTER>Before I take the IT course, I was not aware of IT things and I haven’t learnt any of this topic so I thought myself 
         it is going to be great opportunity to boost up my ability since I can challenge to many things</CENTER></P>
         <h2>Ideal Job</h2>
         <P><CENTER>	This job is a computer engineer who has a primary role regarding developing new types of applications
          and program for mobile, computers and other types of electronic devices. Mobile app developer basically get hired by
          major technology company, but some other software engineers work independently of major company and sell their application
          or program to major company. Developing a new program for existing platform and developing new ideas which are not yet in full
          production is very attractive for me and this was what I was willing to do in the future</CENTER></P>
         <P><CENTER>Typically app developer has a university degree which is related in computer science, computer programming, 
          or others related field. In order to take this position, there are a lot of skills such as communication skills in order
          to perform as a team well and creativity, problem solving and various programming languages. it basically needs for 1 to 5 
          solid years of mobile developing experience. And it also needs for the experience with developing skills such as IOS app or 
          Android app for Google play and App store. Moreover, this position require awareness of various tools such as SQL, JAVA, 
          SSRS/POWER BI. Ultimately the firms seek for the employees who have graduate degrees that focuses on specific aspect of basic 
          programming skills and have a lot of experience in developing field.</CENTER></P>
         <P><CENTER>	I am very strong in communication and problem solving. I always prefer to work as a team or group and having
          a chat regarding the work. I currently take the programming and database concept which is related in developing field 
          and can be utilized for the  future work. I haven’t got any real life experiences regarding app development.</CENTER></P>
         <P><CENTER>	In order to work as an app developer in the future, the first thing that I should improve is programming
          language. i will mainly obtain this skill through the university class and some other extra works in home since I reckon
          that the programming language is the most significant thing to work as a developer. Furthermore I will work as a intern
          in programming firm after I get graduate degree in order to take many useful experiences and be aware of programming industry
          since this will also help me to build higher qualification. </CENTER></P>
         <H2> 3 TESTS RESULTS </H2>
         <P>>The 3 test I have decided to do are;</P>

         <CENTER>The Myer-Briggs Test - The Campaigner (ENFP-T)<CENTER></P>


         <CENTER>What’s Your Learning Style Test - Visual Learner</CENTER><BR>
         <CENTER>Auditory: 25%</CENTER><BR>
         <CENTER>Visual: 45%</CENTER><BR>
         <CENTER>Tactile: 30%</CENTER><BR>

<P>These results clearly show what my strength and weaknesses are, so that it gives me the opportunity to look back myself and recognize what action I should take for improving myself. And moreover, through these tests I could realize of myself clearly so that when I do something with others, I will take action more carefully
Since I identified deeply about my personality and myself.. I know what kind of skills and personality I need so that when I form a team or group, I will take the mature behavior and when I say something to others, I will seriously take a responsibility. Eventually my behavior will be one step improved through these tests.
This tests are giving me the clear section of myself which can be merits or drawbacks, so It will make me think and act carefully every time. And I will rather think others first than thinking myself.</P>
          <h2>PROJECT IDEAS</h2>
          <p>My project is developing the smart phone application called “handy job founder” which can mainly support
           university student to find their appropriate future job and obtain decent information. 
           This will be made as team based project about 3 – 4 people who are in programming related field and it
           is expected to take approximately 1 month to finish this project.</p>
           <p>There are approximately 700,000 graduated students who is seeking for their job appeared every year 
            in Australia.  it is very fatal that huge amount of students literally have no work to do and can’t get a 
            job easily. but when we are trying to find job information from the internet which has vast data, it is very
            difficult to find as well as the recent article, many students get difficulties to make a right choice for their
            work and recognize what kind of job they really desire. What if there is application which can recommend the job
            for users through analyzing users’ interests and tendency? It will be much easier for people to approach perfect 
            job. So that it is indeed vital giving a primary information regarding the job and workplace and recommend the 
            appropriate job. This application might be one of the useful option for students to be aware of job selection.</p>
           <p>This application will seek job by 2 stream, first one is finding jobs through own research, 
            this is the vast database storage to make users to find important information such as wages, qualification
            requirements, skills requirement. Users can find relevant firm in chosen area by automatic GPS and set a location
            in the simple tool bar so that users can only find related information. But some people might have no idea what 
            they are interested in or what they want to be then this is the case for user to take second stream. Before using 
            this, users need to make a account to make their personal profile on this application. They need to take 3 
            representative tests job test, personality test, life style test and then based on these 3 tests results, the 
            application make users’ resume automatically through analyzing what users interests are and what users want. After 
            all of these steps, the application will recommend users appropriate job and user can consider qualifying condition.
            If user dislike, they can swipe left which means that they want to see other firm. If they like the current post, they
            can click the apply button then the application will send users’ resume automatically. This is the basic process of the
            application. Not only these functions, there is a user library function which has a lot of job information for example
            if they want to be programmer, what program they should know how to use or experiences requirements. Information are clearly
            given in this category so that users can obtain what they wanted to know. What the good thing of this application is that
            the application provides tremendous information about the firm that user is looking for and help to connect with firm and 
            user 1 by 1. They can have a rough talks and user can get a great opportunity to think about job again.  Ultimately users 
            can get good chances to meet with a lot of firms and get a good knowledge for improving further.</p>
           <p>For making this application, AppMakr will be mainly used. This software needs almost no programming 
            skills to develop an app which means that it’s really easy to approach and not complicated. This will be
            mostly used to make a basic frame of application. Since app’s UI can also be customized and previewed 
            without high difficulty. So it is best suited to enterprise application start ups as non-skilled workers are 
            required for the app development. Also SQL server will be used in programming, saving users’ database and easily
            manage data.</p>
           <p>Since this project is worked as a group of people around 3-4 which means that teamwork is very important, 
            communication skills will be very significant in both orally and writing. Also sometimes we need to explain the 
            application to non-technical team members so that it requires communication skills to explain the concepts clearly,
            easy to understand. Secondly the creativity, as a mobile developer, we need to know how users incorporate their mobile
            devices into their real lives, and create applications that can support people complete many tasks. Lastly the knowledge
            of programming language will be necessarily needed for developer. Since a lot of software are used in complexity.</p>
           <p>The outcome of this project is to decrease the job seeker who has difficulty to find their appropriate job 
            and get rid of curiosity regarding the job If this project is successfully done, many people will be able to find 
            job much more effectively. They obtain decent information regard their dream job such as what skills they need, what
            they have to be done so their job satisfaction will ultimately increase. Through this, job selection will be more
            stabilized and there will be no people who is struggled to find a job which they really want. </p>
