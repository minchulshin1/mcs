        <P><CENTER>In terms of interest in IT and my personal experiences. I was very interested in IT as the significance of IT has been dramatically increased these days and it becomes such a vital thing to make society changed. So that I wanted to learn and know about IT more like how vast information exchanges, how it solves the problem. </CENTER></P>
        <P><CENTER>Before I take the IT course, I was not aware of IT things and I havenâ€™t learnt any of this topic so I thought myself it is going to be great opportunity to boost up my ability since I can challenge to many things</CENTER></P>
