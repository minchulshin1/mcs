         <CENTER>Interest in IT</CENTER><BR>
        <P><CENTER>In terms of interest in IT and my personal experiences. 
         I was very interested in IT as the significance of IT has been dramatically increased these days and it 
         becomes such a vital thing to make society changed. So that I wanted to learn and know about IT more like how vast information exchanges,
         how it solves the problem. </CENTER></P>
         <CENTER>IT experience</CENTER><BR>
        <P><CENTER>Before I take the IT course, I was not aware of IT things and I haven’t learnt any of this topic so I thought myself 
         it is going to be great opportunity to boost up my ability since I can challenge to many things</CENTER></P>
         <CENTER>Ideal Job</CENTER><BR> 
         <P><CENTER>	This job is a computer engineer who has a primary role regarding developing new types of applications
          and program for mobile, computers and other types of electronic devices. Mobile app developer basically get hired by
          major technology company, but some other software engineers work independently of major company and sell their application
          or program to major company. Developing a new program for existing platform and developing new ideas which are not yet in full
          production is very attractive for me and this was what I was willing to do in the future</CENTER></P>
         <P><CENTER>Typically app developer has a university degree which is related in computer science, computer programming, 
          or others related field. In order to take this position, there are a lot of skills such as communication skills in order
          to perform as a team well and creativity, problem solving and various programming languages. it basically needs for 1 to 5 
          solid years of mobile developing experience. And it also needs for the experience with developing skills such as IOS app or 
          Android app for Google play and App store. Moreover, this position require awareness of various tools such as SQL, JAVA, 
          SSRS/POWER BI. Ultimately the firms seek for the employees who have graduate degrees that focuses on specific aspect of basic 
          programming skills and have a lot of experience in developing field.</CENTER></P>
         <P><CENTER>	I am very strong in communication and problem solving. I always prefer to work as a team or group and having
          a chat regarding the work. I currently take the programming and database concept which is related in developing field 
          and can be utilized for the  future work. I haven’t got any real life experiences regarding app development.</CENTER></P>
         <P><CENTER>	In order to work as an app developer in the future, the first thing that I should improve is programming
          language. i will mainly obtain this skill through the university class and some other extra works in home since I reckon
          that the programming language is the most significant thing to work as a developer. Furthermore I will work as a intern
          in programming firm after I get graduate degree in order to take many useful experiences and be aware of programming industry
          since this will also help me to build higher qualification. </CENTER></P>
         <H2> 3 TESTS RESULTS </H2>
         <P><CENTER>The 3 test I have decided to do are;</CENTER></P>

         <CENTER>The Myer-Briggs Test - The Campaigner (ENFP-T)</CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER>These results clearly show what my strength and weaknesses are, so that it gives me the opportunity to look back myself and recognize what action I should take for improving myself. And moreover, through these tests I could realize of myself clearly so that when I do something with others, I will take action more carefully
Since I identified deeply about my personality and myself.. I know what kind of skills and personality I need so that when I form a team or group, I will take the mature behavior and when I say something to others, I will seriously take a responsibility. Eventually my behavior will be one step improved through these tests.
This tests are giving me the clear section of myself which can be merits or drawbacks, so It will make me think and act carefully every time. And I will rather think others first than thinking myself.</CENTER></P>
