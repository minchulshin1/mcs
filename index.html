          and program for mobile, computers and other types of electronic devices. Mobile app developer basically get hired by
          major technology company, but some other software engineers work independently of major company and sell their application
          or program to major company. Developing a new program for existing platform and developing new ideas which are not yet in full
          production is very attractive for me and this was what I was willing to do in the future</CENTER></P>
         <P><CENTER>Typically app developer has a university degree which is related in computer science, computer programming, 
          or others related field. In order to take this position, there are a lot of skills such as communication skills in order
          to perform as a team well and creativity, problem solving and various programming languages. it basically needs for 1 to 5 
          solid years of mobile developing experience. And it also needs for the experience with developing skills such as IOS app or 
          Android app for Google play and App store. Moreover, this position require awareness of various tools such as SQL, JAVA,

         <P><CENTER>	I am very strong in communication and problem solving. I always prefer to work as a team or group and having
          a chat regarding the work. I currently take the programming and database concept which is related in developing field 
          and can be utilized for the  future work. I haven’t got any real life experiences regarding app development.</CENTER></P>
         <P><CENTER>	In order to work as an app developer in the future, the first thing that I should improve is programming
          language. i will mainly obtain this skill through the university class and some other extra works in home since I reckon
          that the programming language is the most significant thing to work as a developer. Furthermore I will work as a intern
          in programming firm after I get graduate degree in order to take many useful experiences and be aware of programming industry
          since this will also help me to build higher qualification. </CENTER></P>
